# Machine-Learning-Projects  
This repository contains all my machine learning projects,namely:       		

(1)Kaggle Competition: this file contains all the kaggle competitions(machine learning competition website) I joined:https://www.kaggle.com.    

(2)Stock Price Predictor:this file contains my peresonl real-world machine learning project:Stock Price Predictor, which is  designed to predict the future stock price.This predictor ended up using LSTM Neural Network and has been successful reached  67% accuracy for future stock price movement and 92 R_2 Score for the exact future stock price.    

(3)Octave Projects:this file contains all the projects I have done through learning Dr Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursea:https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.    

(4)Udacity Projects: this file contains all the projects I have done through learning the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Udacity:https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009.     

Machine Learning Cheat Sheet: this sheet contains all the basic but important machine learning theroies and implementaion tips.
