This file contains all the kaggle competitions(machine learning competition website) I joined,namely: 
  
(1)Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing:this is a awarded competition(total reward $25,000)on kaggle.It is a regression problem,with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing.I ended up ranking 11% of this competition,used XGboosting,emsemble and stacking algorithems.   
  
(2)Personalized Medicine Redefining Cancer Treatment:this is a awarded competition(total reward $15,000)on kaggle.It is a classification and NPL(Natural Langurage Processing) problem which requires automatically classify genetic variations.I am still doing this one and currently ranking 38%.  
  
(3)Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster:this is Getting Started Prediction Competition on Kaggle.It is a classification problem which aimed to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  
  
(4)House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques:this is Getting Started Prediction Competition on Kaggle.It is a regression problem which aimed to predict the house price based on 79 features.
