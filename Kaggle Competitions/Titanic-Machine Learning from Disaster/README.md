This is Getting Started Prediction Competition on Kaggle.It is a classification problem which aimed to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  
There are 3 notebooks in this file:  
(1)Titanic Data Science Solutions-Example Solution:This is a tutorial I find on Kaggle for this competition,I learned quite a lot feature engineering skills from it.
(2)Decision Tree by hand:this notebook uses the feature engineering from the first one and decomposed decision tree as the predicting model.  
(3)Using RandomForest and GridSearch:this notebook uses the feature engineering from the first one ,RandomForest as the predicting model and GridSearch to tune the model.
