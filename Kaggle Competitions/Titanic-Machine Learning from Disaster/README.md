This is Getting Started Prediction Competition on Kaggle.It is a classification problem which aimed to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.  
There are 3 notebooks in this file:  
(1)Titanic Data Science Solutions-Example Solution:This is a tutorial I find on Kaggle for this competition,I learned quite a lot feature engineering skills from it.(https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions)    
(2)Decision Tree by hand:this notebook uses decomposed decision tree as the predicting model.  
(3)Using RandomForest and GridSearch:this notebook uses the feature engineering from the first one ,RandomForest as the predicting model and GridSearch to tune the model, also apply learning curve and Complexity curve.
