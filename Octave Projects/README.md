This file contains all the projects I have done through learning Dr Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursea:https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.  

There are 8 projects in this file:
(1)Linear Regression:In this exercise, I implement linear regression and get to see it work
on data.  

(2)Logistic Regression:In this exercise, I implement logistic regression and apply it to two
dierent datasets.  

(3)Multi-class Classication and Neural Networks:In this exercise, I implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits.  

(4)Neural Networks Learning:In this exercise, I implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.  

(5)Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s.Variance:In this exercise: I implement regularized linear regression and use it to
study models with different bias-variance properties.  

(6)Support Vector Machines:In this exercise, I use support vector machines (SVMs) to build
a spam classifier.  

(7)K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis:In this exercise, I implement the K-means clustering algorithm and
apply it to compress an image.  

(8)Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systemsï¼šIn this exercise, I implement the anomaly detection algorithm and
apply it to detect failing servers on a network.And then I use collaborative ltering to build a recommender system for movies.
