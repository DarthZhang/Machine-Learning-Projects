this file contains all the projects I have done through learning the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree on Udacity:https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009.

There are 5 projects in this file:
(1)titanic_survival_exploration:In this project,I create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.  
 
(2)boston_housing:In this project.I leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist  clients with finding the best selling price for their home.   

(3)finding_donors:Applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.  

(4)customer_segments:Applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.  

(5)image_classification:Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Tensorflow
