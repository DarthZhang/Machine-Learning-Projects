This file contains my peresonl real-world machine learning project:Stock Price Predictor, which is designed to predict the future stock price.This predictor ended up using LSTM Neural Network and has been successful reached 67% accuracy for future stock price movement and 92 R_2 Score for the exact future stock price.  

This project has been divided into three stages:
Stage 1:using all kinds of predicting model,e.g, Xgboosting,GradientBoosing,Stacking and Ensembling,but not Neural Nets.

Stage 2:Explore the power of Neural Nets,specifically,LSTM-a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN).Tune the model by intuition rather than systematically.  

Stage 3:Systematically tune LSTM-takes around a month,make the conclusion and build the web interface.THe final modelas been successful reached 67% accuracy for future stock price movement and 92 R_2 Score for the exact future stock price.And make aroung 33% profit by using this predition to invest stocks.

PS:currently only traind model for SP500,will train models for more stocks in the near future.
